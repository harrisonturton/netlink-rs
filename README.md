## netlink-rs

A library for interacting
[Netlink-based](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netlink.7.html) Linux
kernel interfaces from Rust.

This is very early, and only implements the core Netlink protocol. Extensions
like [rnetlink](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtnetlink.7.html) are not
supported yet.
